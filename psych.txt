\section{Jobs}

We aren't poor at all.  We have a house.  I don't contribute to my family financially, nor do I get an allowance.  I've never had a job, but I have volunteered or offered to volunteer at different places.

\section{Leisure}

\subsection{General fun}

For fun, I program, read, or play Team Fortress 2.

\subsection{Music}

I enjoy music from lots of genres, but I mainly listen to the same 30 songs over and over.  This is a list:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Paint it Black
    \item Monody
    \item Android Hell Blues
    \item Never Gonna Give You Up
    \item Rust (Monolord)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Books}

I read books from lots of genres, but I don't pay as much attention to genres as others do.  I do normally stick to some form of fiction.  I can enjoy science fiction (Ender saga, most Michael Crichton books), semi-realistic fiction (Robert Langdon, Imagining Argentina), fantasy (ASoIaF).  I guess what I'm looking for is a different world, or a different way to see it.

\subsection{Sports}

I don't currently play or follow any sports.  My parents watch football games when they're on.  My mom was flipping through the channels one day, and found Overwatch being played competitively.  She said it was silly, but then I said that she and dad watch people running at each other in shiny costumes for hours on end.  I don't have any feeling toward Overwatch (it has too many particles for me to make much sense of it), but I felt that it was unfair of her to say that.

\subsection{Movies and TV}

Favorite movies:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Edge of Tomorrow
\end{enumerate}

Favorite shows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Star Trek: Deep Space Nine
    \item Agents of SHIELD
    \item Sherlock Holmes
    \item MLP as of less than four weeks ago on August 2nd, don't tell this to anyone please
\end{enumerate}
