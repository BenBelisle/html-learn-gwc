\section{Jobs}

We aren't poor at all.  We have a house.  I don't contribute to my family financially, nor do I get an allowance.  I've never had a job, but I have volunteered or offered to volunteer at different places.

\section{Leisure}

\subsection{General fun}

For fun, I program, read, or play Team Fortress 2.

\subsection{Music}

I enjoy music from lots of genres, but I mainly listen to the same 30 songs over and over.  I can't usually tell what the people are saying.
